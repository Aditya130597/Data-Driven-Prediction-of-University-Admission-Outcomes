# Educational Institution Prediction Model
# About the company
Jamboree is a renowned educational institution that has successfully assisted numerous students in gaining admission to top colleges abroad. With their proven problem-solving methods, they have helped students achieve exceptional scores on exams like GMAT, GRE, and SAT with minimal effort.

# Problem statement
Jamboree recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective. This analysis will help Jamboree understand what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.

# Benefits of this project
● To further support students Jamboree recently introduced a new feature on their website. This feature enables students to assess their probability of admission to Ivy League colleges, considering the unique perspective of Indian applicants.
● By conducting a thorough analysis, we can assist Jamboree in understanding the crucial factors impacting graduate admissions and their interrelationships. Additionally, we can provide predictive insights to determine an individual's admission chances based on various variables.

# Column profiling
